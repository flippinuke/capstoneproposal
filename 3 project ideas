Betting houses and private gamblers want to make money. The houses need to stay in business, and private gamblers want to beat the system.
Discovering a new method to predict soccer match outcomes will help the owner of that method towards his or her goal.

If these attributes can be discovered, it can help doctors identify people at higher risk of kidney disease.
It can also help those people take preventative action or preparative action.

Term deposits are long term, low-yield, low-risk investments that investors make with a bank for a set amount of time.
The benefit for investors is the low risk. The benefit for banks is the capital influx that they can use for higher yield investments.
Identifying these clients on a large scale can help a bank to plan for these higher yield investments.
It can also help banks identify high quality prospects that did not invest, and to offer them these products.
